## Problem Statement

Define structures with bit-fields to pack data into fewer bits than a full integer. Create a flags structure with 1-bit fields and a date structure with fields sized to their ranges. Print the values and the total size of each struct.

## Theory and Concepts

- Bit-fields allow specifying the exact number of bits for a member: `type name : width`.
- Adjacent bit-fields are packed into the same storage unit (typically an `unsigned int`).
- Bit-fields are non-portable — the ordering and packing depend on the ABI.
- Unnamed bit-fields can be used for padding.
- A zero-width bit-field forces alignment to the next storage unit.
- Taking the address of a bit-field is not allowed (no pointer to a bit-field).

## Real World Application

Bit-fields are used in hardware register definitions (each bit controls a different function), network protocol headers (TCP flags, IPv4 fields), file system inodes, and any scenario where memory or storage is scarce and individual bits carry meaning.

===EXPLANATION===

Bit‑fields were born from the need to speak the language of hardware. In the 1970s, memory cost roughly $5,000 per kilobyte and registers were narrow (8 or 16 bits). Every bit mattered. C's bit‑field feature lets you declare struct members with an exact bit width — `unsigned int visible : 1` uses precisely one bit. The compiler handles the masking and shifting; you just assign to a field as if it were a normal int. The intuition is a drawer divider: without bit‑fields, you'd put one item in each drawer (1 byte per flag). With bit‑fields, you add partitions so one drawer holds 8 tiny compartments — each compartment is a 1‑bit flag, but the drawer itself is still one byte. Professionally, bit‑fields map directly to hardware register layouts. An ARM Cortex‑M system control register might be: `struct { unsigned int sleepdeep : 1; unsigned int reserved : 4; unsigned int sevonpend : 1; } SCR;` — every named field corresponds to a bit position in the hardware manual. Network stacks define TCP header flags as bit‑fields: `struct tcphdr { unsigned int fin:1; unsigned int syn:1; unsigned int rst:1; ... }`. The Ext4 file system on‑disk inode uses bit‑fields for permission flags and file type. Visualize a 4‑byte word as 32 individual light switches. A struct with 1‑bit fields named `visible`, `enabled`, `readonly` controls three switches; the remaining 29 are either unused or used by reserved fields. Key points: (1) bit‑fields are non‑portable — the ABI determines order (left‑to‑right vs right‑to‑left) and whether they span storage unit boundaries; (2) you cannot take the address of a bit‑field (it has no unique byte address); (3) arrays of bit‑fields are not allowed; (4) an unnamed bit‑field of width 0 forces alignment to the next storage unit boundary; (5) the underlying type must be `_Bool`, `int`, `signed int`, or `unsigned int` (C11 also allows other integer types); (6) use bit‑fields for hardware registers and protocol headers — for general boolean flags, a single `int` or `bool` field is simpler and faster.
