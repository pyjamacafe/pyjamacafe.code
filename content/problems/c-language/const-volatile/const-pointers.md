## Problem Statement

Demonstrate the four combinations of `const` with pointers:
1. Pointer to const data (`const int *`)
2. const pointer (`int * const`)
3. const pointer to const data (`const int * const`)
4. Regular pointer to non-const data (`int *`)

Explain which can modify the data and which can be reassigned.

## Theory and Concepts

- Read `const` declarations right-to-left: `const int *` → "pointer to const int" (data is const).
- `int * const` → "const pointer to int" (pointer is const, data is not).
- `const int * const` → "const pointer to const int" (both are const).
- Rule of thumb: `const` applies to whatever is to its left (except when it starts the declaration, then it applies to the type to its right).
- Function parameters are often declared `const T *` to indicate the function does not modify the pointed-to data.

## Real World Application

Choosing the right `const` combination is essential for API design — `const char *` says "I won't modify your string", `char * const` says "I won't change which buffer I'm using", and `const char * const` says both.

===EXPLANATION===

Pointer + `const` combinations are the most confusing aspect of C's type qualifier system for new learners. The rule is simple once you learn to read declarations right‑to‑left. `const int *p` reads as "p is a pointer to const int" — the data is const. `int * const p` reads as "p is a const pointer to int" — the pointer itself is const. `const int * const p` reads as "p is a const pointer to const int" — both are const. Historically, the placement of `const` caused endless debate, leading to the right‑to‑left reading convention inherited from the "declaration follows use" principle in C. The intuition is a delivery truck driver. The driver's route (the pointer `p`) can either be fixed (const pointer) or changeable (non‑const pointer). The cargo (the data `*p`) can be read‑only (const data) or modifiable (non‑const data). If you get `const int *p`, you're a driver whose cargo is fragile ("do not touch"), but you can be assigned different routes. If you get `int * const p`, you're a driver stuck on one route forever, but you can repack the cargo. Professionally, `const char *` is by far the most common — it's how strings are passed to read‑only functions: `size_t strlen(const char *s);` guarantees `strlen` won't modify the string. `char * const` appears when a function owns a fixed buffer: `void log_message(char * const buffer, size_t size)` — the buffer address never changes, but the contents will be written. `const char * const` appears in configuration tables: `const struct config * const table[]` — neither the pointers nor the structs can be modified. Visually, imagine these three scenarios: `const int *p` is a TV remote you can point at any TV, but the remote only has a "mute" button (read‑only). `int * const p` is a remote permanently paired to one TV, but you can change volume, channels, etc. `const int * const p` is a remote permanently paired to one TV and the only working button is "mute". Key points: (1) the mnemonic "read right‑to‑left" works for any declaration — start at the variable name, move right until you hit a delimiter, then left, alternating; (2) `const int *` and `int const *` are identical — both mean "pointer to const int"; (3) `int * const` is different from `int const *` — the former fixes the pointer, the latter fixes the data; (4) when assigning, you can always add `const` to the pointed‑to type (e.g., assign `int *` to `const int *`), but you cannot remove it implicitly (passing `const int *` to `int *` generates a warning); (5) function parameters that are `const T *` accept both `const` and non‑const arguments.
