## Problem Statement

Write a `static` helper function that is only visible within its own file and a public function that calls it. Demonstrate how `static` functions enable encapsulation in multi-file projects — the helper cannot be accessed from other source files.

## Theory and Concepts

- `static` functions have internal linkage — they are only visible within their translation unit.
- This enables information hiding: internal implementation details are not exposed to other files.
- Public functions (non-static) form the module's API; static functions are private helpers.
- This pattern is used throughout the C standard library and most C projects.
- Static functions can also be inlined by the compiler more aggressively since they cannot be called from outside.

## Real World Application

Every well-structured C project uses static functions for encapsulation — a hardware driver exposes `init()`, `read()`, `write()` but keeps internal helper functions (`wait_for_ready()`, `parse_status()`) static. This prevents accidental misuse and reduces namespace pollution.

===EXPLANATION===

In C, `static` applied to a function gives it internal linkage — the function is visible only within the same translation unit (source file). This is C's primary mechanism for encapsulation and information hiding in multi‑file projects. The `static` keyword here has nothing to do with static storage duration (the other use of `static` for local variables). It's about visibility. A `static` function cannot be called from another `.c` file, even if you try to declare it with `extern`. The linker simply doesn't export its symbol. Historically, the `static` keyword for functions dates back to the earliest C compilers, which used it to control symbol visibility in object files — `static` functions generated local symbols, while non‑static functions generated global symbols that the linker could see. The intuition is a restaurant kitchen. The dining room (public interface) has a menu of dishes (public functions) that customers (other source files) can order. The kitchen (`.c` file) has prep cooks, sous chefs, and dishwashers (static helper functions) who are never seen by customers. If a customer tried to walk into the kitchen and order from the prep cook, the maître d' (compiler) would stop them — the prep cook is "static" to the kitchen. Professionally, static functions are used to separate API from implementation. A UART driver `.c` file might have a public function `void uart_init(void)` and static helpers `static void configure_pins(void)`, `static void set_baud_rate(uint32_t rate)`, `static bool wait_for_tx_ready(void)`. The header file `uart.h` only declares `uart_init()`. Other files including `uart.h` can call `uart_init()` but have no knowledge of `configure_pins()` — they can't accidentally call it and cause hardware conflicts even if they knew the function name. This reduces coupling between modules: you can rename or restructure the static helpers without affecting any other file. The compiler can also inline static functions more aggressively since their callers are limited to the same file. Visualize each `.c` file as a house with a front door (public functions) and interior doors (static functions). The front door is accessible from the street (other files). Interior doors are only accessible from inside the house. You can rearrange the furniture and interior rooms without anyone outside noticing. Key points: (1) `static` functions have no external linkage — they cannot be called from other translation units; (2) if two different `.c` files both define a `static` function with the same name, there is no conflict — each has its own private copy; (3) `static` functions are the building block of the "module" pattern in C: a `.c` file with public (non‑static) and private (static) functions; (4) `static` functions cannot be forward‑declared in a header file (doing so would expose them); (5) debug symbols for `static` functions are still generated (for debugging within the file), but the symbols are not exported to the linker.

Hanson; "Large‑Scale C++ Software Design" by John Lakos (applies the same encapsulation principles to C).
