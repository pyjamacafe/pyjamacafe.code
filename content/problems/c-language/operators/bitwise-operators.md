## Problem Statement

Apply each bitwise operator (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`) on two unsigned integers and print the results in binary or hexadecimal. Verify that shift left multiplies by powers of two and shift right divides (for unsigned).

## Theory and Concepts

- `&` (AND): bit is 1 only if both corresponding bits are 1.
- `|` (OR): bit is 1 if either corresponding bit is 1.
- `^` (XOR): bit is 1 if corresponding bits differ.
- `~` (NOT): inverts all bits.
- `<<` (left shift): shifts bits left, fills with 0 — equivalent to multiplying by 2ⁿ.
- `>>` (right shift): shifts bits right — for unsigned, fills with 0 (logical shift).
- Bitwise operators work on integer types only.

## Real World Application

Bitwise operations are essential in embedded programming — setting/clearing hardware register bits, implementing flags and permissions, CRC computation, cryptography, compression, and graphics (color channel masking).

===EXPLANATION===

Bitwise operators in C directly reflect the machine instructions of the PDP-11, where Ritchie developed the language. The PDP-11 had `BIC` (bit clear), `BIS` (bit set), and `XOR` instructions that mapped naturally to `&`, `|`, `^`, and `~` [1]. Shift instructions `<<` and `>>` corresponded to `ASL` (arithmetic shift left) and `ASR`/`LSR` (arithmetic/logical shift right). These operators have remained unchanged because they map one-to-one to hardware on virtually every architecture. The C standard guarantees that left shifts and right shifts of unsigned types are logical (zero-filled), while right shifts of signed types are implementation-defined (usually arithmetic, preserving the sign bit).

The intuition: each bitwise operator works on every bit position independently. Think of `&` as a "both" test (both bits must be 1), `|` as an "either" test (at least one is 1), `^` as a "different" test (exactly one is 1), and `~` as a "not" test (flip every bit). Left shift `<< n` moves every bit n positions left, filling with zeros on the right — multiplying by 2^n when overflow doesn't occur. Right shift `>> n` moves bits right — for unsigned types, it's division by 2^n; for signed types, it preserves the sign bit (arithmetic shift).

Real code uses bitwise operators for performance-critical operations. The Linux kernel uses them for every hardware register access: `writel(val | BIT(5), reg)` sets bit 5 of a register [2]. Redis uses `&` for type checking: `type = obj->type & OBJ_ENCODING_MASK` [3]. SQLite uses `>>` and `&` for varint decoding: `val = (val << 7) | (bytes[i] & 0x7F)` [4]. Git uses `^` in its packfile CRC computation.

```c {title="src/bitmap.c (Redis)", note="Redis uses bitwise ops for efficient bitmap operations"}
void setBit(robj *o, off_t offset, int val) {
    unsigned char *bit = (unsigned char*)o->ptr + (offset >> 3);
    int mask = 1 << (offset & 0x7);
    if (val)
        *bit |= mask;
    else
        *bit &= ~mask;
}
```

Visualize bitwise operations on an 8-bit value: `a = 0b11001100`, `b = 0b10101010`. Then `a & b` = `0b10001000` (bits 7 and 3 are set in both), `a | b` = `0b11101110` (every position where either has a 1), `a ^ b` = `0b01100110` (positions where they differ), `~a` = `0b00110011` (all bits flipped). Shift `a << 2` = `0b00110000` (bits shifted left, zeros on right).

**Key points to never forget:**
- `<< 1` multiplies by 2; `>> 1` divides by 2 (for unsigned).
- `x & (x - 1)` clears the lowest set bit — a classic O(1) population test.
- Use unsigned types for bitwise operations to avoid sign-extension surprises.
- `1 << 31` overflows a 32-bit signed int — use `1U << 31`.
- Bitwise operators have lower precedence than arithmetic — `x & 3 == 2` is `x & (3 == 2)`, not `(x & 3) == 2`.
