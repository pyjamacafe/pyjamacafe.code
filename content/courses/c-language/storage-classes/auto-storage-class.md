## Problem Statement

Declare a local variable with the `auto` keyword (which is the default for local variables). Explain that `auto` is redundant in modern C and is almost never used. Its meaning in C is different from C++ `auto`.

## Theory and Concepts

- `auto` specifies automatic storage duration — the variable is created when the block is entered and destroyed when it exits.
- In C, `auto` is the default for local variables — writing it is optional and rare.
- The `auto` keyword in C has a different meaning from C++11's `auto` (type deduction).
- Other storage class specifiers: `static`, `extern`, `register`, `typedef`.
- `auto` cannot be used at file scope (file-scope variables have static storage duration).
- Understanding `auto` is primarily of historical interest — it comes from BCPL/B where variables had to be explicitly declared as `auto` or `static`.

## Real World Application

The `auto` keyword is rarely seen in modern C code. Its main relevance is historical and for understanding C's storage class system. Some coding standards explicitly forbid using it since it adds no value.

===EXPLANATION===

The `auto` keyword in C is a ghost — technically present in the language, syntactically valid, but almost never written. To understand why it exists, you have to travel back to the late 1960s and the language BCPL, C's direct ancestor. In BCPL, every variable declaration required an explicit storage class: `auto` meant "on the stack" and `static` meant "in static memory." There was no default — if you forgot the keyword, the compiler rejected your code. When Ken Thompson created B (a simplified BCPL), he kept this requirement. Then Dennis Ritchie designed C, and he made a pragmatic decision: make `auto` the default for local variables so programmers could omit it. The keyword was kept in the language for backward compatibility — it didn't hurt anything, and it made mechanical translation from B programs easier. It has been dead weight ever since.

Think of `auto` in C as the emergency brake on a passenger train. It's still there — you can pull it if you want — but nobody does, because the train already stops at every station without it. The brake (the keyword) does exactly the same thing as the default behavior (automatic storage duration). Pulling it changes nothing. In C++11, the same word was given an entirely new meaning (type deduction via `auto`), which created a minor confusion: in C, `auto int x = 5;` declares an integer; in modern C++, `auto x = 5;` deduces `int`. But the two languages are on different trajectories here, and the C standard has chosen to keep the original meaning despite its obsolescence.

In professional C code, you will search long and hard to find `auto` used as a storage class specifier. The Linux kernel coding style explicitly says not to use it. The MISRA C guidelines don't even bother forbidding it — it's so rare it's not worth mentioning. When you do encounter it, it's typically in code written by someone learning C from an outdated textbook or in automatically generated code that uses explicit storage class specifiers for every variable. Even the C standard committee has discussed removing it, but backward compatibility concerns keep it alive.

Visually, imagine a row of switches labeled "auto," "static," "extern," "register." The first switch is in the "on" position by default for local variables. Writing `auto` is like flipping the switch to "on" and then immediately flipping it back to "on" — no change occurs. The switch exists because it was required in an earlier model of the machine (BCPL/B), but in the current model (C), it's wired directly to the same circuit.

Key points: `auto` specifies automatic storage duration — the variable's lifetime matches the block's execution. In C, `auto` is the default for local variables, so writing it is always redundant. `auto` cannot be used on file-scope variables (they have static storage duration by definition). The keyword is not a type qualifier or part of the type system. In C++, `auto` was repurposed in C++11 for type deduction, a completely different meaning. The C standard (N1570 draft, §6.7.1) still lists `auto` as a storage class specifier, but zero usage is the practical standard.

For historical context: "The Development of the C Language" by Dennis Ritchie (ACM HOPL-II, 1993). For the current standard, see ISO/IEC 9899:2011 §6.2.4 (storage durations) and §6.7.1 (storage class specifiers).
