## Problem Statement

Write a `static` helper function that is only visible within its translation unit and a non-static function that calls it. Demonstrate that the internal function cannot be called from another file (by trying to use `extern` in a comment).

## Theory and Concepts

- `static` on a function gives it **internal linkage** — it is only visible within the same translation unit (.c file).
- Non-static (regular) functions have **external linkage** — visible across all files of the program.
- Using `static` for file-internal functions is a good practice; it reduces namespace pollution and enables compiler optimizations.
- Internal linkage also prevents accidental name clashes with other files.

## Real World Application

Most non-trivial C projects use `static` for internal helper functions — utility functions in a module that are not part of the public API, hardware abstraction layer (HAL) internals, and callback wrappers that should not be exposed.

===EXPLANATION===

Static functions are one of C's most underappreciated tools for managing complexity. Before they existed, every function in a C program was potentially visible to every other file — the equivalent of every room in a house having a door that opens to the street. Early C programmers quickly learned that this caused chaos: two programmers working on different files could accidentally define a helper with the same name, and the linker would either pick one arbitrarily (with a warning) or produce a cryptic duplicate-symbol error. The `static` keyword on a function was the fix: it says "this function is internal to this file — it's nobody else's business."

Think of static functions as unlisted phone numbers. Anyone inside the building can dial them, but they don't appear in the public directory. When you mark a function `static`, you're telling the compiler and linker: this function is for internal use only. The compiler can then optimize more aggressively — it knows no external caller will ever jump to this function, so it can inline it, eliminate its frame, or even remove it entirely if all callers are inlined. This is a form of information hiding, long before object-oriented programming formalized the concept.

In real-world C projects, static functions are ubiquitous. The Linux kernel, one of the largest C codebases in existence, uses `static` on the vast majority of its helper functions. When a device driver needs a function to parse a register value — a function that should never be called from outside that driver — it's marked `static`. The SQLite database engine, a model of C craftsmanship, wraps nearly every internal operation in static functions. Embedded firmware projects hide hardware-specific initialization sequences behind static functions. Even the C standard library uses them: many implementations of `printf` have a static helper `putchar_wrapper` that buffers output before writing.

Visually, imagine a library with two sections: the public shelves (externally linked functions) and the staff-only back room (static functions). Any patron can browse the public shelves and take a book. But the back room is locked — only employees can enter. The `static` keyword is the lock on that door. When the linker builds the program, it sees dozens of .c files (each a room) and connects the public doors with hallways. A static function has no hallway — it's accessible only from within its own room. The compiler draws a boundary around the translation unit and says: nothing outside this boundary can reference this symbol.

Key points: `static` on a function gives it internal linkage — it's visible only within its translation unit. Non-static functions have external linkage by default. A `static` function cannot be called from another file, period — not with `extern`, not with a function pointer obtained through tricks. Using `static` enables the compiler to perform dead-code elimination (if the function is never called) and more aggressive inlining. It prevents namespace pollution and accidental linking conflicts. Static functions are also the foundation of C's module pattern: expose a minimal public API, hide everything else behind `static`.

For further exploration: the C standard §6.2.2 (linkages of identifiers), "The Practice of Programming" by Kernighan and Pike (chapter on interface design), and the Linux kernel coding style guidelines on static functions.
