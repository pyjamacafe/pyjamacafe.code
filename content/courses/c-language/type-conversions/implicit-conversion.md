## Problem Statement

Write mixed-type arithmetic expressions and observe how the compiler implicitly converts operands to a common type. Compare the results when the same operation is stored in a `float` vs an `int` to see precision loss and truncation.

## Theory and Concepts

- Implicit conversion (type promotion) happens automatically in expressions with mixed types.
- Usual arithmetic conversions: smaller types are promoted to larger ones (`int → long → float → double`).
- Integer promotion: `char` and `short` are promoted to `int` in expressions.
- Assigning a larger type to a smaller type truncates or may lose precision (compiler may warn).
- Conversion direction: `int → unsigned → long → long long → float → double → long double`.

## Real World Application

Implicit conversions happen constantly in real code — mixing indices with sizes, sensor readings with calibration factors, and loop counters with floating-point accumulators. Understanding them prevents precision loss and sign-related bugs.

===EXPLANATION===

Implicit type conversion, often called type coercion, is one of C's oldest features — it has been part of the language since Dennis Ritchie first designed it at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. The rationale was pragmatic: programmers should not have to manually cast every operand in mixed-type expressions. If you add an `int` and a `double`, the compiler should just do the right thing.

The intuition is simple: when two operands have different types, the compiler promotes the smaller or less precise type to match the larger or more precise one. This happens rank by rank: `int` → `long` → `long long` → `float` → `double` → `long double`. Think of it as a ladder — every operation climbs to the highest rung present. For example, in `double result = i + f` where `i` is `int` and `f` is `float`, both are promoted to `double` before addition, and the full-precision result is stored. But in `int result = i + f`, the `float` sum is truncated back to `int`, losing the fractional part silently.

Professionally, implicit conversions are everywhere. A financial application might compute `total = principal + interest * years` where `interest` is a `float` and `years` is an `int` — the multiplication promotes `years` to `float`, potentially introducing tiny rounding errors that compound over millions of transactions. A game engine mixing `int` frame counters with `float` delta times can accumulate precision drift. An embedded sensor reading stored as an `int` and multiplied by a `float` calibration factor triggers an implicit promotion every cycle.

Picture the conversion visually: imagine two measuring cups, one marked in whole ounces (`int`) and one in milliliters (`float`). To combine them, you pour the ounces into the milliliter cup — the whole number becomes a real number with a `.0` tail. That is implicit conversion in action. The reverse — pouring milliliters into the ounce cup — truncates any fractional milliliter, which is what happens when you assign a `float` to an `int`.

Key points:
1. Implicit conversion follows the usual arithmetic conversion rules, always toward the wider type.
2. Integer promotion promotes `char`, `short`, and `_Bool` to `int` before any operation.
3. Assignment to a narrower type truncates without warning.
4. Signed-to-unsigned conversion in comparisons can cause logical surprises (see the signed-unsigned topic).
5. These conversions happen silently — the compiler does not ask permission.


For deeper study, read the C11 standard sections 6.3.1 (arithmetic operands) and 6.3.1.8 (usual arithmetic conversions). "Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets" by Peter van der Linden has an excellent chapter on type conversions. The CERT C Coding Standard rule INT02-C also covers understanding implicit conversions to prevent data loss.
