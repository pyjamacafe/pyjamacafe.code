## Problem Statement

Compare a negative signed integer with a positive unsigned integer. Print the result of the comparison and explain why it is counterintuitive. Also print the signed value using `%u` (unsigned format specifier) to see the wrapped value.

## Theory and Concepts

- When comparing `signed int` with `unsigned int`, the signed value is implicitly converted to unsigned.
- Negative numbers wrap to large unsigned values (e.g., -1 becomes 2³²−1 on 32-bit).
- This can cause `s < u` to be false even when s is -1 and u is 1.
- Always be aware of implicit signed/unsigned conversions — they can introduce subtle bugs.
- Enable compiler warnings (`-Wsign-compare` or `-Wall`) to catch these issues.

## Real World Application

Signed/unsigned comparison bugs are notorious in production code — loop conditions like `i < array.length` where `i` is signed and `length` is unsigned can fail. This category of bug affected Java`s `Arrays.binarySearch` and countless C/C++ projects.

===EXPLANATION===

The signed-to-unsigned conversion quirk is one of C's most infamous foot-guns, and it traces back to the language's philosophy of speed over safety. When K&R C was designed, hardware used two's complement arithmetic, and the implicit conversion rules were chosen to map directly to machine instructions — no extra compare-and-branch overhead. The result is that comparing a signed and unsigned value in C silently promotes the signed value to unsigned, which for negative numbers produces huge positive values.

Here is the intuition: on a 32-bit system, `unsigned int` ranges from 0 to 4,294,967,295. A `signed int` of -1, when reinterpreted as unsigned, becomes 4,294,967,295 (all bits set). So `(-1) < 1u` evaluates to false because under the hood the comparison is `4294967295u < 1u`. The comparison does what the bits say, not what the programmer intended.

A real professional example: in 2014, a bug in Apple's SSL/TLS implementation (the famous "goto fail" bug) involved a signed/unsigned comparison in a `memcmp`-like function, but the more common variant appears in loop conditions. Imagine: `for (int i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++)` — `strlen` returns `size_t` (unsigned). If `strlen` returns 0, a signed `i` going negative wraps to a huge unsigned value when compared, and the loop never terminates. This exact pattern has caused denial-of-service bugs in web servers and infinite loops in embedded firmware.

Visualize signed and unsigned as two different clock faces. A signed 8-bit integer goes from -128 to +127, like a clock with -128 at the top and +127 half a turn later. An unsigned 8-bit integer goes from 0 to 255, with 0 at the top. When you compare values across the two faces, -128 on the signed clock maps to 128 on the unsigned clock — it jumps halfway around the dial. The same bit pattern (10000000) represents -128 on one face and 128 on the other.

Key points:
1. In any mixed signed/unsigned operation, the signed value is implicitly converted to unsigned.
2. Avoid mixing signed and unsigned in comparisons — enable `-Wsign-compare` to catch them.
3. Use `size_t` for sizes and indices consistently to avoid the issue.
4. Literal constants like `1` are signed by default; use `1u` for unsigned.
5. The conversion is defined by the standard (C11 §6.3.1.3) — it is not undefined behavior, just surprising.
