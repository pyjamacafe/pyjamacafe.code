## Problem Statement

Demonstrate zero initialization of structs and arrays using `{0}` initializer and `memset`. Show that `int arr[10]` without an initializer contains garbage (automatic storage) while `int arr[10] = {0}` is zero-initialized.

## Theory and Concepts

- `= {0}` initializes the first element to 0 and all remaining elements to zero (recursively for aggregates).
- This is the standard idiom for zero-initializing any aggregate type.
- `memset(&s, 0, sizeof(s))` sets all bytes to zero — functionally same as `= {0}` for most cases.
- Automatic variables NOT explicitly initialized contain indeterminate values — always initialize before use.
- Static and global variables are zero-initialized automatically even without `= {0}`.
- For pointers, `{0}` sets them to `NULL`; for floats, to `0.0`.

## Real World Application

Zero initialization is the most common initialization pattern — resetting state structures, clearing buffers, initializing configuration defaults, and preparing memory for use. The `{0}` idiom is shorter and less error-prone than `memset`.

===EXPLANATION===

Zero initialization is the silent workhorse of C programming. Every time you write `= {0}`, you're telling the compiler to set every byte of the variable to zero. This works for any type — scalars, arrays, structs, unions — making it the universal "blank slate" initializer. Historically, `= {0}` emerged as the idiomatic way to zero‑initialize aggregates. `struct sensor s1 = {0};` sets all fields to zero. For scalars, `int x = 0;` achieves the same, but `int x = {0};` also works (the braces are absorbed). The underlying guarantee is in ISO C11 §6.7.9/19: if an aggregate has fewer initializers than members, the remaining members are zero‑initialized. Since `{0}` provides exactly one initializer (zero) for the first member, everything else gets zero recursively. The intuition is a factory reset button. Pressing `= {0}` on any variable returns it to a known, clean state — all bits cleared, pointers set to NULL, floats set to 0.0. It doesn't matter how complex the type is; `{0}` recursively resets every sub‑member. Professionally, zero initialization is used everywhere. A network server clears connection state between requests: `struct connection conn = {0};` — every field (buffer pointers, state enums, timestamps) starts at a safe default. Embedded firmware initialises peripheral configuration structs with `{0}` before setting specific fields, ensuring unused fields don't contain stale values. The Linux kernel uses `= {0}` extensively in drivers to zero‑initialize structures like `struct device`, `struct resource`, and `struct file_operations`. The alternative `memset(&s, 0, sizeof(s))` does the same thing but is less type‑safe, more error‑prone (wrong size), and cannot be used on `const` variables. Visually, imagine a grid of little switches, each representing one bit. `{0}` flips every switch to the OFF position. For a struct like `struct sensor { int id; float value; char name[20]; };`, `{0}` flips all 28‑byte's worth of switches to OFF. The compiler generates the most efficient code — possibly a single `memset` or a series of store instructions.

Key points:

. `= {0}` is the standard idiom for zero‑initializing any variable — it works for all types, including nested structs and arrays;
. for automatic variables, `= {0}` is strictly better than leaving them uninitialized, which is undefined behaviour to read;
. static and global variables are zero‑initialized without `{0}` — but using it explicitly is harmless and documents the intent;
. `{0}` sets pointers to NULL (all‑bits‑zero is the null pointer representation on all mainstream platforms, though the C standard only guarantees that `(void *)0` is a null pointer);
. `memset` is still useful for re‑zeroing already‑allocated memory at runtime.
